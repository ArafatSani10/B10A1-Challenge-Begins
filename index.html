                    <h1>Why Web Development??</h1>
                    <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                        building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser.</p>

                    <div class="first-box">
                        <h1>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h1>
                        <p>Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. These instructions determine
                            what actions a computer can and cannot take. Coding allows programmers to build programs,
                            such as websites and apps. Computer programmers can also tell computers how to process data
                            in better, faster ways.

                        <p>Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are
                            offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or
                            use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors.</p>
